# Fix CRLF Progress Reporting

Fixes progress reporting on GCODE files with CRLF line endings. If your GCODE viewer appears to be way behind on
what is currently being printed in *OctoPrint 1.4.0*, try this plugin.

The underlying issue in question will be fixed in OctoPrint 1.4.1, at which point this plugin will no longer be
required. Consequently it will only run on OctoPrint 1.4.0.
